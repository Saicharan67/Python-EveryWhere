PAINTING ON AN IMAGE USING OPENCV
==========================================================================

To paint on an image first we load an image and then initialize a variable to false so we can control the drawing as if the variable is set to true then we can draw.We call the functon draw circle by setMouseCallback.Here we just need to specify on which window we need to call which function and opencv will automatically take the x, y co-ordinates and the mouse event(left click,right click,mouse move) and we can also pass additional variable param and it takes variable of value flag which is set initially to false.
