FACE DETECTION USING OPEN CV
==========================================================================

Face detection is mostly done by using haarcascade classifier.The steps to do are:

1.Importing libraries

2.Loading the image and converting it into gray scale


The reason for this is gray channel is easy to process and is computationally less intensive as it contains only 1-channel of black-white.

3.Detecting features

Now we try to find the co-ordinates of face to draw a rectangle around the face and here we face_classifier,in_built function detectMultiScale, haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml.
In detectMultiScale we pass parameters:
a.GrayScale image
b.scaleFactor — Parameter specifying how much the image size is reduced
c.minNeighbors — Parameter specifying how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it. This parameter will affect the quality of the detected faces

4.Drawing rectangle

It gives four co-ordinates x,y,width of image,height of image

5.Displaying output and text

putText takes following parameters

1.image
2.text to be displayed in string
3.fontFace:type of font style
4.org:co-ordinates to display
5.color:rgb values
6.fontScale:fontsize
